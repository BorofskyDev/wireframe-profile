##Introduction

American culture, deeply rooted in diverse philosophical traditions, has been significantly influenced by the thoughts of John Calvin and Thomas Hobbes. These philosophers, known for their somewhat cynical views on human nature, have left an indelible mark on the collective psyche. However, an unlikely source, the comic strip "Calvin and Hobbes" by Bill Watterson, offers a refreshing and optimistic perspective on humanity. This essay explores the negative influences of Calvin and Hobbes' philosophies and argues that "Calvin and Hobbes," with its portrayal of adventure and inherent goodness, presents a more positive and realistic view of human nature.

###The Philosophical Impact of John Calvin and Thomas Hobbes
John Calvin's Pessimism

John Calvin, a leading figure of the Protestant Reformation, propagated the doctrine of predestination, which suggests that the fate of each individual is predetermined. This notion, inherently pessimistic, implies a lack of individual agency and portrays humans as inherently sinful and in need of strict control. Calvin's influence is evident in American culture, particularly in the Puritanical roots of early American society, fostering a sense of guilt and the need for rigid societal norms.

###Thomas Hobbes' Cynical View of Human Nature

Thomas Hobbes, a 17th-century English philosopher, is best known for his work "Leviathan," where he describes human life in a state of nature as "solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short." Hobbes advocated for a powerful sovereign to control the inherently selfish and aggressive tendencies of humans. His philosophy underpins many aspects of American political and social structures, emphasizing the need for strong governance to maintain order.

##The Contrast: "Calvin and Hobbes"
###Embodiment of Adventure and Innocence

"Calvin and Hobbes," a comic strip featuring a young boy, Calvin, and his anthropomorphic tiger friend, Hobbes, stands in stark contrast to the grim outlook of Calvin and Hobbes. The strip celebrates the joys of childhood, imagination, and adventure. It portrays Calvin's world as one where anything is possible, and adventures are a daily occurrence, reflecting an optimistic view of human nature.
Human Nature: Intrinsically Good and Creative

Unlike the philosophers, the comic strip suggests that humans are not inherently evil or in need of control. Instead, it portrays humans (through Calvin) as imaginative, curious, and capable of great things. The adventures of Calvin and Hobbes are often chaotic but underscore a fundamental goodness and creativity in human nature.
A Lesson in Empathy and Friendship

The relationship between Calvin and Hobbes is one of mutual respect, empathy, and understanding. It provides a stark contrast to the philosophies of Calvin and Hobbes, which often lack an emphasis on empathy and interpersonal relationships. The comic strip teaches us that at our core, humans are social beings capable of deep connections.

##The Negative Influence of Calvin and Hobbes on American Culture
###Pervasive Pessimism and Control

The philosophies of John Calvin and Thomas Hobbes have contributed to a culture that often views human nature pessimistically. This perspective has led to systems and structures designed to control and regulate, rather than nurture and understand. The emphasis on inherent sinfulness and selfishness has overshadowed the potential for goodness and altruism in society.
###Impact on Governance and Society

The influence of these philosophers is seen in the governance structures that prioritize order and control over freedom and creativity. This has led to a culture where conformity is often valued over individual expression, and fear of chaos overrides the celebration of spontaneity and adventure.
##The Positive Influence of "Calvin and Hobbes"
###Celebrating Creativity and Freedom

"Calvin and Hobbes" celebrates the human spirit in its most unbridled form. It encourages creativity, freedom of thought, and the joy of exploring the unknown. The comic strip serves as a reminder that at our core, humans are not just beings to be controlled, but individuals capable of remarkable creativity and adventure.
Inspiring a More Optimistic Worldview

The comic strip inspires a more optimistic view of human nature. It encourages readers to embrace their inner child, to see the world with wonder and excitement, and to believe in the inherent goodness of people. This perspective is a refreshing antidote to the cynicism and control-oriented philosophies of Calvin and Hobbes.
###A Model for Empathetic and Authentic Living

Calvin's relationship with Hobbes, full of imagination, empathy, and genuine emotion, provides a model for how we might interact with each other. It suggests that a society based on understanding, imagination, and spontaneity could lead to more fulfilling and authentic lives
